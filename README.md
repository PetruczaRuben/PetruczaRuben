😶‍🌫️ I'm a frontend developer who is passionate about making the web accessible to everyone and advocating for building open and inclusive developer communities. 

When I'm not coding, you can find me on CodeWars geeking about the most performant competetive coding solutions.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Angular
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on React and Vanilla JS projects.
- 💬 Ask me about: JavaScript, React.js, CodeWars, Responsive Design
- 📫 How to reach me: petrucza.ruben@gmail.com
- ⚡ Not so fun fact: I'm a strong advocate on a balanced and healthy lifestyle, I like to spend time in nature and workout
